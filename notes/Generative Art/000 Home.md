## Generative ART MOC

Generative Art (and [[Creative Coding]]) is a broad term for any computer generated form of art, this could be audio, random, algorithmic, or even mixed media between an algorithm and human input. There are many techniques here and tools. One of the early ones was [[Processing]], which also influenced [[Arduino]] (on the embedded side). I was introduced to the concept through an interview with [[Tyler Hobbs]] (about his [[NFTs]] [[Fidenza]]) which uses a [[Flow Field]]

Following is an example from [[Fidenza]] which started as  big inspiration:

### The Studio

[[Studio Setup]]

### Tools

As an overview there are a ton of programming tools, but the main ones I am interested in are:

- [[Nannou]] which uses [[Rust]]
- [[Quil]]
- [[Processing]]
- [[OpenRNDR]]

### Techniques

- [[Flow Field]]
- [[Probabilistic Color Palettes]]
- [[Cellular Automaton]] 
	- [[Agents or Actors]] and their interactions

- [[Pointalism]]
- [[Fractal Patterns]]
- [[Randomization]]
- [[Areas of Negative Space]]
- [[Composition Anchor points]]
- [[Bezier Curves]]

### Pieces and Series

[[R00_RandomCircles]]

### Next actions

- Build a easier way to generate through using seeds and make a set of images (reproducible from seed once algorithm settled)
- Play with [[Flow Fields]]
