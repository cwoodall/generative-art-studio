## Working Memory

- Test the repeatable inputs
- Screenshots custom naming from the camera to include seed, width, height, iteration_number
- Make some of the CLI stuff part of the base template 
- Generic way to deal with scaling things by the width and height... constants + maybe an object to handle this? This can be gross and global, it is creative coding... who cares?
