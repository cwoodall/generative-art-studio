## Overtone

Overtone is:

> Overtone is an open source audio environment designed to explore new musical ideas from synthesis and sampling to instrument building, live-coding and collaborative jamming. We combine the powerful [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/) audio engine, with [Clojure](http://clojure.org), a state of-the-art lisp, to create an intoxicating interactive sonic experience.

Like [[TidalCycles]] based on [[SuperCollider]], but instead it uses [[Clojure]] and can mesh well with [[Quil]] which uses [[Processing]] under the hood.
