## TidalCycles

https://tidalcycles.org/

From the website:

> Tidal Cycles (or 'Tidal') for short is free/open source software written in Haskell. Tidal is using SuperCollider, another open-source software, for synthesis and I/O.
> 
> Tidal Cycles allows you to make patterns with code. It includes language for describing flexible (e.g. polyphonic, polyrhythmic, generative) sequences of sounds, notes, parameters, and all kind of information.

Uses [[Haskell]] underneath and [[SuperCollider]]

### Examples
