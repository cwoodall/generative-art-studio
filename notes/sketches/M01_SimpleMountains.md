## M01_SimpleMountains

### Overview

### Algorithm

### Progression

### Future Work

- I need to know more about [[Color Theory]] and have better [[Probabilistic Color Palettes]]
- Do this in 3d! This could be really neat, the same concept should scale
- Experiment with adding more mountain shapes and smoothing them with a low pass filter.

### Things Learnt

- [[OpenRNDR#Live programming]]
- [[OpenRNDR#ScreenRecorder Video]]
- Played with subcontours, and other such things.
- Created code for sampling a contour at equal distance spacings and turning it into rectangles (#refactor)
- Created code for creating some reasonable mountains actually
- 3d cameras https://openrndr.discourse.group/t/how-to-use-orbitalcamera-and-orbitalcontrols-in-only-some-parts-of-your-program/53
