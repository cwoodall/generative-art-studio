## P02_G02_SpaceColonization_Paths

### Algorithm

Using the [[Sovol Pen Plotter]] draw a path generated by [[G02_SpaceColonization_NodeSizeBasedOnChildCount]] or [[G01_SpaceColonization]].

Start by generating the SVG paths. I realize I want direct paths rather than objects or shapes

Imported SVG into inkscape running the [Sovol-SO1 plugin](https://sovol3d.com/pages/so-1-document-download) (running in a Windows VM).

As generated ![[Pasted image 20210823214121.png]]. This is as a very precise contour path which has a lot of points in it and is not well deduplicated, or streamlined. This generates the following G-Code: 

![[1223-1.gcode_SO-1.gcode]]

Can then load this into the SD Card. This initial plot causes constant penup and pendown movements

##### Future Work

Have not yet found the issues. To go further I will probably want to use inkscape to print out some basic shapes. Then generate some more basic curves. Then figure out how to get those basic curves to link up properly. Right now my issues is that all of the line segments are disjoint
