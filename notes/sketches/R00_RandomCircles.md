## R00_RandomCircles

Random Circles is based on randomness and some code from [ericyd on Github](https://github.com/ericyd/generative-art/blob/main/openrndr/src/main/kotlin/sketch/S30_Dunes.kt) to get myself started

### Algorithm

- Draw 5 random circles of random location and a gausian distribution of radii with a mean between the min radius (1) and the max radius 1000
- FIll them with a random color

### Goal

The goal was just to make sure I can get [[OpenRNDR]] working and to learn a little [[Kotlin]] and also start a workflow for generating and curating images. Needs more fomalization, but it is a start

### Curated Results
