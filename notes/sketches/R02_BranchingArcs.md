## R02_BranchingArcs

### Working Log

starting with simple random circles then drawing arcs of various lengths with probabilistic times where the arc ends

- Added arcs
- Need to make trees
- Need to make it so the circles radius can go in either direction
- Added basic collision detection, but it needs improvement
- Arcs go on both ways now
- Generally rather satisfying to watch, but the end results are questionable
- Take video for this one.
